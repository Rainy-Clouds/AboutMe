    <h2>More about me!</h2>
    <p1>I'm from Brooklyn, New York.
      I got into coding and computer science at a relatively young age, since my dad got me into coding basic when I was 7 or 8.
      I really found my passion for computer science, however, when I was in 5th grade and began making games in Scratch.
      From there, I self taught myself Python in 6th and 7th grade, and later C# in Unity when I was a sophomore and junior in high school.
      Developing video games slowly became my passion, and still is to this day.
      Some other things I'm very interested in are Mario and Nintendo games which I've loved for almost all my life, running and cycling which are my favorite activities for staying fit, and chemistry, a subject that never ceases to amaze me.
